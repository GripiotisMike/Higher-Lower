# Higher Lower Game

- In this Project I learned Object Oriented Programming (OOP)!

## Overview
The Higher-Lower Game is a fun, interactive game where you are given two random entities, each with a description and their social media follower count. Your task is to choose which entity has more followers. The game continues until you make an incorrect guess.

## Features
Compare two random entities (such as celebrities, brands, athletes, etc.)
Each entity is displayed with its name, description, and country of origin.
You need to guess which entity has more followers on social media.
The game keeps track of your score until you make a wrong guess.
